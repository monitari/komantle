KOMANTLE is a word similarity guessing game inspired by the original 꼬맨틀 site. This project uses JavaScript to replicate the core functionality of the game.

## How to Play

1. Enter a word in the input field and click the "Submit" button.
2. The game will calculate the similarity between your guess and the target word.
3. The similarity score and rank (if applicable) will be displayed.
4. Keep guessing until you find the target word!

## Features

- Calculates word similarity based on pre-defined data.
- Displays the number of attempts and average similarity score.
- Provides a modal with game instructions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have a local server to serve the files (e.g., using VSCode Live Server extension).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game.
